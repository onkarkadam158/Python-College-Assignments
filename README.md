# Python-College-Assignments
Python Fundamentals assignments to be performed in college

1. Create a list of different data fields and use appropriate Python data types to represent each of them. (Case study: - You are required to design the data structure to display the individual player stats for cricket players. A player may have represented more than one team and may have played in more than one format such as Test, ODI and T20) 

2. Assume that there are the top 5 performers. Write a Python program to decide the player with the highest points. Develop separate functions to compute batting and bowling points and save them in a module. The performance of each player is stored in a dictionary object. These functions should be imported into the main code.  (Case Study: - The 'Man of the Match' award of a 50-over cricket match is decided by computing points earned by players. The points are calculated on the basis of the following rules:  
             Batting                         
             • 1 point for 2 runs scored                         
             • Additional 5 points for half century 
             • Additional 10 points for century 
             • 2 points for strike rate (runs/balls faced) of 80-100                         • Additional 4 points for strike rate>100                    
             • 1 point for hitting a boundary (four) and 2 points for over 
             boundary (six)              
             
             Bowling                        
             • 10 points for each wicket                        
             • Additional 5 points for three wickets per innings                
             • Additional 10 points for 5 wickets or more in innings            
             • 4 points for economy rate (runs given per over) between 3.5 and 4.5                        
             • 7 points for economy rate between 2 and 3.5                                   • 10 points for economy rate less than 2                
            
            Fielding                        
             • 10 points each for catch/stumping/run out 
             
3. Design a ‘book’ class with title, author, publisher, price and author’s royalty as instance variables. Provide getter and setter properties for all variables. Also define a method royalty() to calculate royalty amount author can expect to receive the following royalties:10% of the retail price on the first 500 copies; 12.5% for the next 1,000 copies sold, then 15% for all further copies sold.         Then design a new ‘ebook’ class inherited from ‘book’ class. Add ebook format (EPUB,    PDF, MOBI etc) as additional instance variable in inherited class.  Override royalty() method to deduct GST @12% on ebooks

4. Write a python program to perform operations  on stack  

5. Write a python program to perform operations on queue.

6. Write a python function which accepts two linked lists containing integer data and an integer, n and merges two linked lists, such that list2 is merged with the list1 after n number of nodes.

7. Write a python function which accepts a stack of integers, sort it in 
ascending order and return the sorted stack.
