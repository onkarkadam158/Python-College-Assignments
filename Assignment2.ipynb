        "2. Assume that there are the top 5 performers. Write a Python program to decide the player with the highest points. Develop separate functions to compute batting and bowling points and save them in a module. The performance of each player is stored in a dictionary object. These functions should be imported into the main code.  (Case Study: - The 'Man of the Match' award of a 50-over cricket match is decided by computing points earned by players.
